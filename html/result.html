        By comparing the image with Banksy's art, the image is belonged to the Banksy's style of art for four reasons
        which is color, slogan, street art and subject. The image is used most of black and white colors to create this
        street art and has a slogan near the painting. Also, the most of subjects in Banksy's art work often include
        rats, apes, policemen, soldiers, children, and the elderly. And the subject of image is a child which is similar
        with Banksy's art work.
        <div>Besides, the red spray paint in boy's hand is pointed that the painting is made by spray lacquer which is
            same with the Banksy's painting material. The boy also held a paper with the word of "stencils". For
            minimizing time for painting, Banksy devised a series of intricate stencils for drawing. Thus, this painting
            was a imitation for Banksy's art style and commenmorated Banksy's art by using Banksy's painting styles.
