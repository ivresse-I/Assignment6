    <div class="content">
        Active since the 1990s, Banksy's satirical street art and subversive epigrams combine dark humour with graffiti
        executed in a distinctive stenciling technique. Banksy devised a series of intricate stencils to minimise time
        and overlapping of the colour.
        His works of political and social commentary have appeared on streets, walls, and bridges throughout the world.
        <div>His artwork can be rebellious and is known for delivering political messages. Banksy's stencils feature
            striking and humorous images occasionally combined with slogans.
            The message is usually anti-war, anti-capitalist or anti-establishment. Subjects often include rats, apes,
            policemen, soldiers, children, and the elderly.
            <div>Banksy's art works used black in abundance, and spot colors on occasion. Black silhouette features
                strongly, and as much as possible there are no words unless words are absolutely required. Most of
                Banksy's art works are made by a handful of words and a single can of spray paint.
